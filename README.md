## What did I learn?
- Create simple, impactful and understandable visualizations
- Build an interactive report using `Dash` and `Plotly`
<br>

## Why this project?
I started this project after reading the book: [storyteling with data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) to practice communicating and presenting my findings. The dataset is fictional, it comes from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t=242s*).  I have no expertise in selling tech products.
